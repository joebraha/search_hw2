The presence of communication amid scientific minds was equally important to the success of the Manhattan Project as scientific intellect was. The only cloud hanging over the impressive achievement of the atomic researchers and engineers is what their success truly meant; hundreds of thousands of innocent lives obliterated. The scientists and engineers working on the Manhattan Project needed to be able to talk to each other in order for their project to be successful. The only bad thing about their achievement is that it led to a lot of innocent people losing their lives.
The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science. The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped end World War II. The project's legacy has led to many peaceful uses of atomic energy that still affect history and science today.

The Manhattan Project. This once classified photograph features the first atomic bomb â a weapon that atomic scientists had nicknamed Gadget.. The nuclear age began on July 16, 1945, when it was detonated in the New Mexico desert. The Manhattan Project was a secret photo of the first atomic bomb, which scientists called Gadget. It was tested in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, starting the nuclear age.
Nor will it attempt to substitute for the extraordinarily rich literature on the atomic bombs and the end of World War II. This collection does not attempt to document the origins and development of the Manhattan Project. This book won't replace the many books about atomic bombs and World War II. It also doesn't try to tell the story of how the Manhattan Project was created.
Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs.

One of the main reasons Hanford was selected as a site for the Manhattan Project's B Reactor was its proximity to the Columbia River, the largest river flowing into the Pacific Ocean from the North American coast. Hanford was chosen for the Manhattan Project's B Reactor because it is close to the Columbia River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean from the north.
